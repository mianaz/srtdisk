# Note: Utility functions for matrix validation and transformation were removed
# as they were not integrated into the codebase. If needed in the future,
# consider implementing them directly in the calling code or re-adding them here.
# The following functions were removed:
#   - ValidateMatrixDimensions
#   - ExpandMatrixToFullFeatures
#   - EnsureUniqueMatrixNames
#   - ConvertToSparseIfBeneficial
